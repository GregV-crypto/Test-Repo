Update as of 9/22/21:
So far, everything is going well. Calculator project is at version 1.5.

Update as of 1/20/22:
C calculator was meant as a small side project to get more well-versed in C for a Computer Science Course I took during the Fall 2021 semester. 
I find it to be a nice reminder of the past and what I started with. However, after moving to higher-level languages like JavaScript and Python,
it has fallen by the way side for a long time. This will change soon though. C is a fun, albeit tedious language to work in.
